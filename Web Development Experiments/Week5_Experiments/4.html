        <h1>In-place text editing in jQuery</h1>
    </div>

    <h3>Below is a editable text from Lorem Ipsum:</h3>
    <form>
        <input type="hidden" name="text2" />
    </form>
    <p id="txtedit">
        "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
        <br />
        account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.
        <br />
        No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
        <br />
        rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of
        <br />
        itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
        <br />
        To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has
        <br />
        any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
        <br />
        produces no resultant pleasure?"
    </p>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var newtext = $('<input name="text1" type="text" />'),
         oldtext = $('input[name="text2"]');
        $('#txtedit').editme(newtext, oldtext);

        <h3> Code Snippet:</h3>
        <code>
            current.hide();<br />
            current.after(newtext);<br />
            newtext.focus();<br />
            newtext.blur(function () {<br />
            if ($(this).val() != &quot;&quot;) { <br />
            oldtext.val($(this).val()).change(); <br />
            current.text($(this).val()); <br />
            } <br />
        </code>

        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            In this experiment, jQuery has been used to perform in place editing. When the text in the editable DIV is clicked,
            a text box appears. The data entered in the new text box replaces the old data in the tag  &lt;p&gt;. On click, the current &lt;p&gt; data hides and
            a new textbox appears at the same place. The new textbox after editing is then focussed and displayed on screen.
            <br /> The jQuery code
            then checks whether the initial text has been changed or not. If not will display the same text.
            <br /> If changed will
            display the updated text.
