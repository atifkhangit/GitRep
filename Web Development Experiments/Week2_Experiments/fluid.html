                "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment,
                so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their
                duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
                distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best,
                every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations
                of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in
                these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."

        <p><h2> This is a fluid layout experiment with multiple blocks of div tag </h2></p>

        <p>
            The purpose of this experiment is to test on resizing of the window the text in the respective blocks gets re-aligned.
            As the size of window gets smaller the text in each div block aligns itself and the div block expands vertically.
            No horizontal bar appears as the windows size is reduced.
